# ASSESSMENT 1: Career Readiness

The LEARN program focuses on readying our students for a career in technology. The job hunt is a daunting process that requires a lot of preparedness. Complete the following tasks to ensure progress in your professional development.

LinkedIn is the world's largest online professional networking community. An active presence on LinkedIn allows you to make professional connections, look for employment opportunities, connect with others who share your interests, and learn more about the tech industry.

- Submit your "about me" statement:

A small introduction from myself, Andre, I grew up in a small town in the Philippines. Having being brought up by an Asian household, medicine or law were my only two options for a career path to please my family. And so here I am, halfway across the world, in pursuit of something that I would love and enjoy. During my time in the military as a medic for the United States Navy, I have come to a conclusion that medicine is not the line of work I would like to be in. However, time spent in service was not for naught, for it has taught me patience, discipline, and the ability to work under extreme pressure. I have always been fond of problem-solving, creating, and modifying anything I could possibly get my hands on, and I have found the career path and community, unique only to the tech industry.
